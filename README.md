`qrandom` is an R package providing an interface to the [ANU Quantum Random Number Generator](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/index.php) provided by the Australian National University. An ultra-high bandwith of true random numbers is generated in real-time by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. The quantum Random Number Generator is based on the papers *[Real time demonstration of high bitrate quantum random number generation with coherent laser light](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3597793)* by Symul et al., (2011) and 
*[Maximization of Extractable Randomness in a Quantum Random-Number Generator](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.054004)* by Haw, et al. (2015).

### Key Features
This package offers functions to retrieve a sequenze of random integers or hexadecimals and to generate true random samples from a normal or uniform distribution. Functions of `qrandom` are:

* qrandom (sequence of random numbers)
* qrandomunif (random numbers from a uniform distribution)
* qrandomnorm (random numbers from a normal distribution)

Installation
------------
```r
# The easiest way to install qrandom is to download via CRAN
install.packages("qrandom")

# Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skoestlmeier/qrandom")
```
Notes
-----

* **qrandom**

  This function generates a true random sequence of up to 1,024 numbers per request. The type
  - 'uint8' generates integer values between 0 and 255 (both including).
  - 'uint16' generates integer values between 0 and 65,535 (both including).
  - 'hex16' generates hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (both including).
  
  The 'blocksize' is only needed for request type 'hex16' and sets the length of each block which can be a length between 1 and 1,024 (both including).
  Further information can be obtained by the official QRNG\@ANU JSON API documentation [here](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/api-demo.php).

* **qrandomunif**

  This function returns a sample of 1 - 1,024 true random numbers from a uniform distribution with parameters a (minimum value) and b (maximum value).
  Per default (a=0 and b=1), a standard uniform distribution is assumed.

  Normalization of data into the interval [a; b] is done by using the "min-max" formula as described [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/178629/188976). This method can not be applied for one single number as this would result in the attempt of a  division by zero. For two number, this method results into returning 0 and 1 in all cases. So if only one or two numbers are requested, these numbers (which are within the interval [0; 65,535]) are divided by their possible maximum value of 65,535. For all requests with three or more true random numbers, the mentioned min-max normalization is used.

* **qrandomnorm**

  This function implements 'qrandom' and transforms the true random sequence into random numbers from a normal distribution with parameters mean = a and variance = b.
  The transformation is done via ... . Be default, the transformation results in a standard normal distribution
  with mean 0 and variance 1.
